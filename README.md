# Hi, I'm Alvin ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer. I learned to code at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/)'s web development bootcamp. I am a Google Cloud certified [Associate Cloud Engineer](https://googlecloudcertified.credential.net/profile/d98c3d51d00bacb8e7019aab6b1f0b3235b16ac6), and I am also developing my knowledge and skills in [cybersecurity](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/alvin-lim.e5f04753/badges).

Before my career transition to technology, I was in academia. I received my M.A. in Philosophy from the National University of Singapore and my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa.

I taught subjects like Philosophy and Political Science at Pannasastra University of Cambodia, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the American University of Nigeria.

My writing portfolio can be found on [Academia.edu](https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/AlvinLim). I occasionally [blog on DEV](https://dev.to/alvinqingxing). My website is at [alvinlim.me](https://alvinlim.me/).
