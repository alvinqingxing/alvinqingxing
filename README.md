# Hi, I'm Alvin ðŸ‘‹

I am a writer at [HTX (Home Team Science & Technology Agency)](https://www.htx.gov.sg/) and before this was a web developer at [Singapore Discovery Centre](https://www.sdc.com.sg/). I learned to code at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/singapore/web-development-course/full-time) with support from the [Infocomm Media Development Authority](https://www.imda.gov.sg/) of Singapore's [Tech Immersion and Placement Programme (TIPP)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/imtalent/programmes/tipp). I occasionally write apps -- for example the no-code meditation app [Serenity Now](https://serenity-now.glideapp.io/dl/d0a5f4) -- and am a Google Cloud-certified [Associate Cloud Engineer](https://www.credential.net/68ac2aae-956e-4833-b1d1-c56d53785bf8).

Before my career transition to technology, I was in academia. I received my M.A. in Philosophy from the [National University of Singapore](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/philo/) and my Ph.D. in Political Science from the [University of Hawaii at Manoa](https://politicalscience.manoa.hawaii.edu/), and have taught at [Pannasastra University of Cambodia](http://www.puc.edu.kh/), the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the [American University of Nigeria](https://www.aun.edu.ng/).
