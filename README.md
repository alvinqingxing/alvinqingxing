# Hi, I'm Alvin ðŸ‘‹

I am a web developer who trained at [Le Wagon Singapore](https://www.lewagon.com/singapore). My technical stack includes:
* Ruby on Rails
* JavaScript
* Python
* SQL
* Bootstrap

Before my career transition to technology, I was an educator. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and I taught at Pannasastra University of Cambodia, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the American University of Nigeria.
