# Hi, I'm Alvin ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at [Interiio.sg](https://www.interiio.sg/). I learned to code at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [Firebase.io](https://www.firebase.io/), and [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

Before my career transition to technology, I was an educator.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and I have taught at Pannasastra University of Cambodia, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the American University of Nigeria.

My writing portfolio can be found on [Academia.edu](https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/AlvinLim). I occasionally [blog on DEV](https://dev.to/alvinqingxing).
