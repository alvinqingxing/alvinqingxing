# Hi, I'm Alvin ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at [Interiio.sg](https://www.interiio.sg/). I learned how to code from [Le Wagon Singapore](https://www.lewagon.com/singapore), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

Before my career transition to technology, I was an educator. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and I taught at Pannasastra University of Cambodia, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the American University of Nigeria.

I occasionally blog on [DEV](https://dev.to/alvinqingxing).
